To get the app running:

* npm install

* npm start

* open a browser and navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

* [Testing using the API sandbox](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/articles/using-sandbox)

* 2018-01-03 Avram followed these directions (after cd'ing into connect-examples/v2/node_payment) and the node server crashed on localhost:3000 page load. Did not debug.
